Let me start this post by saying that I’m not a great student. Don’t get me wrong, I love to learn, but college (and school in general) is completely broken and an update is urgently needed, but I’ll leave that for another post.

I didn’t want to go to college, but I was just an 18-year-old kid and I figured that I didn’t have much choice. The only thing I knew about college was that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were drop outs, which, as you can imagine, gave me a bad feeling about it. Within a month I thought I was right. Nothing changed from high school and college was just a memory game with some assignments to make us work. Classes were boring and teachers were explaining things that I could easily pick up reading a book or some documentation online. Teachers were stuck on their own world and had no idea what the industry was using. They were using books with 20 years old and I just couldn’t stand it.

My grades were far from great as you can expect from a guy that hated college. I even considered changing degree but after a bit of research I found out that everything was the same. I could have changed for an easier degree (because engineering is hard) but I would have a tough time finding a job with a shitty degree, so I stayed and made an extra effort even though I was hating every second of it.

Life went on, my grades did not get better, but eventually things started to make a bit more sense. The goal was to finish my degree and find a job, but my family kept pressuring me to get a Masters degree. Like I haven’t suffered enough.

I had made my choice that I would not waste time on getting a masters degree, but suddenly my degree had changed to an integrated master’s degree. I figured I shouldn’t leave in the middle of it and I decided to finish it.

Suddenly a lot changed. Almost every course is picked by me and I could find what I really like and focus on those courses. Classes were smaller so everything was a bit more personal, which I enjoyed very much. My grades obviously got better (not by much though) and I think I made the right decision. I’m not so sure if a master’s is a big deal professionally but that’s not the reason I’m taking it. I’m learning a lot of useful stuff and I believe that will help me become a better professional.

Right now I’m in a good spot. I finally reached college nirvana and I’m able to understand it better. Don’t get me wrong, I still think that I won’t use half of what I learned and my garbage collector will eventually pick it put, but I don’t consider college a waste of time. I made a bunch of friends and met a lot of really intelligent individuals. I learned a shitton of stuff not only about computer engineering but about everything. It was not bad but thank God it’s almost over.

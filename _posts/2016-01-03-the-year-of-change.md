2016 is probably going to be the most stressful year ever, and I couldn't be more excited about it!

If everything goes well 2016 will be my graduation year. I have only a couple of courses left and the **dissertation**.

I picked something related to programming languages because that never gets old. To keep it short, It's about evolving codebases on a safe way, allowing the programmer to reason about the different variations. How I'm tackling this problem and what I'm exactly doing, I'll leave it for another post.

So that's a big thing. It's going to keep me busy for the majority of the year. It will culminate into a presentation that should occur on late October.

By the end of that, I will say goodbye to college. I'll be production ready and start working. But working on what?

More than anything 2015 has been a reflection year. I used the year mainly to think about my future and to be sure about what I wanted to do. I did courses on operating systems, programming languages, distributed systems, web development and software engineering. That helped me realize what I did and didn't like.

I settled for web development for now—front end to be exact. The web is everywhere and I've always liked it, ever since the golden days of Dreamweaver[^dreamweaver].

More than anything, I think 2016 will be the year where I strengthen my position as a web developer. This blog is helping me with that task, as well as some projects that I have in the oven that are also helping me consolidate a lot of new stuff that I'm learning.

Then there is something that I still haven't quite figured it out. Where do I see myself working?

+ What type of company? A consulting company? A tech giant? A small startup with a bunch of cool dudes?
+ Would I be comfortable working remote? Or would I rather work on a cubicle with little to no privacy?
+ Do I search for a job only in Portugal, where the hours are long and the pay is not great? Or do I venture myself into another country?

So I'm aware that the ideal job is not going to pop up out of nowhere, and I most likely need to start from the bottom to prove what I'm worth. But there still a lot of open questions that need an answer, and I'm hoping I can use the first half of 2016 to figure it out.

Looking a bit into the future, eventually, I think I would like to design and develop interfaces only. Interfaces are the thing that connects the machine with the user so it's an area that needs a lot of tinkering and attention to detail. And I believe I can use my engineering background as an advantage.

🍻 Here's to an amazing year with a lot of changes and some good surprises.[^emoji]

[^dreamweaver]: And I kid you not, I know people that still use Dreamweaver.

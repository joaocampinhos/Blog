This is the first post to mark the beginning of this blog.

I don't know what I'm going to write exactly but 90% of the articles will be tech related.

I've been wanting to start writing again for some time but I was missing a topic. About two days ago I was talking to a friend and I realized that everything that I know today is because someone was willing to share that with me. It's only logical that I do the same. That's why I wanted to start this blog. So I can share my knowledge and hopefully learn a bit more along the way.

Writing feels so good in so many ways. I can exercise my English, so I don't struggle that much when I start writing my dissertation. It helps me structure my thinking that can easily get me lost. Overall It's a good habit that I'm trying to get.

And this blog is so smart! It can do all sorts of things. And because I'm still experimenting, here's what this blog can do for now:

+ **Bolds** and *Italics*
+ [HYPERLINKS!](#)
+ Hardcore code `rm -rf /`
+ <abbr title="Abbreviations">abbr</abbr>.
+ <cite>Citations</cite>
+ And a <del>shitton</del> <ins>fuckload</ins> of <sup>really</sup> <sub>cool</sub> stuff.
+ Also footnotes, which I absolutly love[^fn-omg]

What? headings? how about those

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

How about images? I can do images like a boss.

And tables

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>smart</th>
      <th>tables</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>are</td>
      <td>smart</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>

And code
{% highlight js %}

// Please no!
function sum(a, b)
{
    return a + b;
}


// That's better
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

{% endhighlight %}


*And that's it. Stay tuned for more serious posts!*

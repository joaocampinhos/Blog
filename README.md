# [Blog](http://blog.campinhos.pt)
This website is my corner office on the open space that the web is. It’s where I write about everything and anything, and most importantly, it’s mine and no one else’s space. And because it’s my space I did it my way.

Powered by the lovely guys at Github, it’s completely open source so you’re free to judge my code (please don’t)
Since it’s using Github Pages, it uses Jekyll under the hood, and it works, so… yay?
I’m also using some code from Poole made by the Bootstrap guy.
Oh and fonts! I’m using some cool fonts that I spent a couple hours picking (please don’t judge me, I like pretty things). I’m using Montserrat for the headings and Crimson Text for the body. For the code snippets, I’m using Source Code Pro because it has pro in the name, and that means it’s a professional font, because that’s a thing.

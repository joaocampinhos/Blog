Why hello there! My name is João Campinhos and I'm a computer engineering student at [FCT-UNL](http://www.fct.unl.pt/). Overall I'm just a regular guy that likes to code and build stuff. When I'm not ranting about college and struggling to check items on my to-do lists, you can probably find me reading *everything* about technology and science, or maybe watching TV---let's go with reading.

I'm fascinated by the human being and everything that we've invented, like the wheel, the selfie stick or the Internet. And because the Internet is a big deal and I feel like I owe something to those Internet guys, here I am on a mission to create a better Internet for everyone, whatever that means.

Fluent in web development shenanigans, I'm trying to make the world a better place one CSS line at a time. And if that sounds like an impossible mission, and even though I'm no Tom Cruise, you can check my progress on my [work](/work) page.

If you want to get in touch with me, it's best if you ping me on Twitter [@joaocampinhos](https://twitter.com/joaocampinhos) or just do it the traditional way and send me an [email](mailto:joao@campinhos.pt). However, if you are a recruiter and you love your generic emails, don't bother.

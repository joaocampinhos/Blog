Why hello there! My name is Jo√£o Campinhos and I'm a computer engineering student at [FCT-UNL](http://www.fct.unl.pt/). Overall I'm just a regular guy that likes to code and build stuff. When I'm not ranting about college and struggling to find 25 hours on a single day, you can probably find me reading *everything* about technology and science.

I'm fascinated by the human being and everything that we've invented, like the wheel, the selfie stick or the Internet. And because the Internet is a big deal and I feel like I owe something to those Internet guys, here I am on a mission to create a better Internet for everyone, whatever that means.

If you want to get in touch with me, it's best if you ping me on Twitter [@joaocampinhos](https://twitter.com/joaocampinhos) or just do it the traditional way and send me an [email](mailto:joao@campinhos.pt). However, if you are a recruiter and you love your generic emails, don't bother.

# About the site

This website is my corner office on the open space that the web is. It's where I write about everything and anything, and most importantly, it's mine and no one else's space. And because it's my space I did it my way.

+ Powered by the lovely guys at [Github](https://github.com/), it's completely [open source](https://github.com/joaocampinhos/blog) so you're free to judge my code (please don't)
+ Since it's using Github Pages, it uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) under the hood, and it works, so... yay?
+ I'm also using some code from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) made by the [Bootstrap guy](https://twitter.com/mdo).
+ Oh and fonts! I'm using some cool fonts that I spent a couple hours picking (please don't judge me, I like pretty things). I'm using [Montserrat](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat) for the headings and [Crimson Text](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Crimson+Text) for the body. For the code snippets, I'm using [Source Code Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) because it has pro in the name, and that means it's a professional font, because that's a thing.

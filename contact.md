Feel free to contact me for pretty much anything. I would love to read your take on some of the topics that I cover here since I'm always interested in knowing different opinions.

If you want to know anything about me ask away on my [GitHub AMA](https://github.com/joaocampinhos/ama) repository.

The fastest and more reliable way to contact me is probably via [email](mailto:joao@campinhos.pt), but feel free to [tweet](https://twitter.com/joaocampinhos) me if you have a simple question or want to chat on a more informal tone.

I am also always looking for challenges so if you think I might be a good fit, head over to my [work](/work) page to discover how can I help you.
